I made burger steak with fries and salad last night and would like to share the recipe on this post. Burger steak is a popular lunch selection in Asia, which is usually a large piece of burger meat with sauce, often larger than a regular burger. My burger steak has a cheddar cheese stuffing and were served with redwine pepper sauce, fries made from potato and yam, and a simple tomato lettuce salad. Here are the steps:

2 lbs of lean ground beef are mixed with 20g breadcrumbs, a spoon of milk, salt, blackpepper, a little nutmeg, and onion bits slightly fried in butter. Shape the mixed ground beef into 2 round patties, put cheddar cheese on each patty and fold so that the cheese is stuffed inside. Pan fry the burger steaks until cooked.

I used an airfrier for the fries. A yam and 2 potatos are cut into stripes and mixed with some oil. It took the airfrier 20 minutes to make the fries.

When burger steaks are done, put them aside to rest. Add onion bits to the pan to brown. Add red wine, vinegar, soy sauce, garlic and butter. Cook for 2 minutes to reduce.

Make lettuce tomato salad and serve.
